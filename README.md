# Pytorch Overview

Welcome to my repository on Pytorch and machine learning library for Python.  The aim of this repository is to give you a foundation in when, why and how to use Pytorch.  This repository includes the following:

## **Included resources:**


**Introduction to Pytorch Powerpoint**
    
o The aim of this presentation is to give you terminology, tips and a base understanding of the background of pytorch. 

**Torch Diagram pdf**

o	This is included in a slide of the powerpoint, but it’s helpful to understand the difference between Torch, Torchvision, and Torchaudio. 

**Tensors Jupyter Notebook**

o	A very basic starting to see and play with Tensors which are a pivotal part of Pytorch.

**Efficientnet Jupyter Notebook**

o	This highlights how to load a dataset and premade model from Torchvision.  It also brings you through the journey of using a premade model.

**SVHN Jupyter Notebook**

o	This builds on the previous notebook and expands our knowledge of Tensors.  We’re able to customize the model we previously used to increase performance(hopefully).  We stop and look into a Tensor with actual data, and look more closely at the performance of the model.


## **Get Started**

To install Pytorch it’s very simple:  open a terminal and type the following command:

**pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio**

If you’d like to customize your setup to include using a GPU, or if you have Mac or Linux OS, please follow the link for install instructions: [Start Locally | PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
